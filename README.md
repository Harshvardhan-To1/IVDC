**IVDC AUTONOMY INDUCTION**

This project is created by me for the Induction task of IVDC IIT Indore, The tasks were combined of topics like path planning, computer vision, ROS etc.

Out of these the attempted by me is Computer Vision which is completely done by me while I have also attempted path planning but only theory parts due to lack of time.

For the theory part I have used google to research and chatgpt for refrence purposes.Link for the sam is as follow:

Coming to code part, I have initially performed some image processing , using PIL library's Image function, after that I tried out basic CNN models but due to 

unsatisfctory accuracy, I also tried models like MobileNetV2 and Efficients Net BO.
